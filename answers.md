Sample interview questions follow. There will only be a small number for the sprint challenge, but this shows the flavor of the questions.

What are some examples of instructions handled by the CPU (as opposed to the ALU)?


//BASE 10 - Decimal 
//BASE 2- BINARY

//HEX -->BIN??
Convert the 8-bit hex number 0xB7 to binary.
10110111


//BIN-->HEX //byte&bits are diff. //8-bits=1byte
Convert the 8-bit binary number 0b10101011 to hex.

Describe the bitwise operations needed to turn off the 5th bit from the right of 0b01111100.

Why do people tend to gravitate towards base-10 number systems while computers do better with base-2?

Create an AND mask to preserve the last 3 right-hand bits of any 8-bit number.

Describe the relative strengths and weaknesses RAM versus registers.
